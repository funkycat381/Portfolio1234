<p>Brown Outdoor Leadership Training is a Brown University program that teaches leadership and outdoor skills to rising
    sophomores and upperclassmen trip leaders through trips to the White Mountains in New Hampshire. This community has
    been an integral part of my undergraduate experience.</p>
<p>In Fall 2022, BOLT's steering committee, of which I was a member, was tasked with redesigning the curriculum we use
    to train our new backpacking trip leaders. This overhaul included minor things like updating links to references, to
    starting some trainings, such as "Wellness on Trail" from ground zero. When committee members perused the old lesson
    plans, they found them difficult to read and also non-standardized. I, particularly concerned about this problem,
    decided to tackle it in addition to the curricular reforms I was participating in.</p>
<p>By creating this new layout, with a brand-new cover page detailing need-to-know-information, in addition to
    typography edits throughout the document, I was able to create a more readable, and thus effective, lesson plan for
    the next semester's trainings.</p>
